# Android Playground

This repository is a collection of small Android practice projects implemented in Kotlin using Jetpack Compose. Each project was built while following Google's `Android Basics with Compose` course (https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/course) and is intended for learning, experimentation, and reference.

Each project lives on its own git branch so you can switch to the branch for the exercise you want to run, open the project in Android Studio, and run it on an emulator or device.

## Projects

1. [BusinessCard](https://github.com/frost23z/android-playground/tree/BusinessCard)
2. [ArtSpaceApp](https://github.com/frost23z/android-playground/tree/ArtSpaceApp)
3. [30DaysApp](https://github.com/frost23z/android-playground/tree/30DaysApp)
4. [MyCityApp](https://github.com/frost23z/android-playground/tree/MyCityApp)


## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

## Quick start

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/frost23z/android-playground.git
   cd android-playground
   ```

2. Switch to a project branch you want to run (example: `ArtSpaceApp`):

    ```bash
    git checkout ArtSpaceApp
    ```

3. Open the project in Android Studio. Let Gradle sync and then run on an emulator or device.

Notes:
- The repository is organized by branches for each project. Opening the root folder in Android Studio and switching to a branch is the easiest way to work on a particular exercise.

## Conventions and notes
